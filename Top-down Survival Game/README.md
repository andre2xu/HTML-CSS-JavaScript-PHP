# **JavaScript Survival Arcade Game**
A top-down game where the player has to survive endless waves of enemies. The first three rounds are simple, they give the player a chance to warm up and adjust to the mechanics of the game. However, from wave 4 onwards, enemies begin to increase in number and in difficulty; health & ammo drops also become scarce forcing the player to shoot wisely just to survive. The game comes with a HUD that displays the player's health & ammo count, as well as the wave they are on and how long they have been playing for - some of these stats can be saved to the leaderboard, provided the player has made an account and is logged into it before starting the game.
