# **JavaScript Survival Arcade Game**
A top-down game where the player has to survive endless waves of enemies. The number of enemies rise steadily at the start of the game but eventually it becomes random later on. The enemies themselves also become increasingly difficult as the game progresses, further adding to the game's intensity! The game comes with a HUD that tells the player their health & ammo count, as well as what wave they are on and how long they have been playing for -  players have been given the option to make an account in the main menu in order to save some of these stats to the global leaderboard for everyone to see.
